# Project Progress: Autonomous LLM Chromium Security Researcher

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core CLI Integration (COMPLETE)

- [X] **Create `PROGRESS.md`**: This file will track the overall progress of the project.
- [X] **Set up the basic project structure**: Create the necessary directories and files for the new feature.
- [X] **Integrate the chatbot into the CLI**: Add a new command `ch agent` to the `chromium-helper-cli` tool.
- [X] **Implement basic chat functionality**: Create a simple REPL for the chatbot.

## Phase 2: LLM Integration and Communication (COMPLETE)

- [X] **Implement LLM communication module**: Create a module to handle communication with AI providers.
- [X] **Develop the main LLM researcher agent**: Coordinate research efforts and manage specialized agents.
- [X] **Implement persistent data storage**: Store data from specialized agents.

## Phase 3: Specialized Agents (COMPLETE)

- [X] **Develop the Proactive Bug Finding agent**: Analyze Chromium's source code for vulnerabilities.
- [X] **Develop the Bug Pattern Analysis agent**: Learn from past security incidents and extract bug patterns.
- [X] **Develop the Codebase Understanding agent**: Learn from Chromium code behavior.
- [X] **Integrate specialized agents with the main LLM researcher**: Enable communication and task delegation.

## Phase 4: Dynamic Agent Creation and Advanced Features (COMPLETE)

- [X] **Implement dynamic agent creation**: Allow the main LLM researcher to create new agents (via GenericTaskAgent).
- [X] **Integrate with `chromium-helper-cli` features**: Leverage existing tools for code interaction (ChromiumAPI integration).
- [X] **Refine and test**: Thoroughly test and refine the system (initial pass done).
